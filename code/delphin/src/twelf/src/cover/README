Coverage Checker
Author: Frank Pfenning with Carsten Schuermann

Version 1 --- only closed queries and predicates
          --- only input coverage

Coverage checking is local.  See also %total below.

Syntax:

%covers mdecl.

where mdecl is a short or full mode declaration.

+ means input coverage
* means no coverage checking
- means no coverage checking (see %total below)

Mon Mar 12 23:27:16 2001 -fp
Version 2 --- added proper constraint handling

- When constraints remain after splitting, try to split over other
  candidates.  If no candidates can be split, fail.

- When constraints remain after matching, fail.

Mon Mar 19 07:16:19 2001 -fp
Version 3 --- added totality checking for closed worlds
          --- still no subordination

Syntax:

%total tdecl.

where tdecl is a termination declaration.

Version 4 --- worlds, subordination, and finitary splitting
Tagged as input-cover on branch coverage

- added worlds and variables blocks to coverage checking
- added subordination when generating EVar's in order
  to prevent spurious dependencies
- generalized checking for impossible cases
  by checking for variables with finitely many
  instances without creating recursion
- uses subordination in order to eliminate some
  apparent recusion fo finitary splitting.

Instruction for branch on coverage:

     % tag currently checked out version

     cvs tag -b coverage     % tag current working version
     cvs update -r coverage  % switch current working version to branch

     % checking out a branch (alternative to cvs update -r coverage)
     cvs checkout -r coverage twelf

     % merging changes from a branch back into the main development
     cvs checkout twelf      % get fresh copy of main branch
     cd twelf                
     cvs update -j coverage  % join branch coverage
     cvs commit -m "included branch 'coverage'"
			     % commit changes to main branch

Hi Frank:

Sorry for answering only now.  I just got back and it is pretty busy here.
Just to make sure that the table is correctly implemented, I send you the
version we came up with ... Just to compare.

    SBVar E    Const/BVar/PVar:  Add E to candidate set
    Const    Const/BVar/PVar:    Empty local candidate set, fail
    LVar     Const/BVar/PVar:    Empty local candidate set, fail
    ...    EVAR:    Generate local constraints
    EVAR    ...:    Skip
    Param x    Const/BVar:    Empty local candidate set, fail
    Param x    PVar:    (what did we agree on here?)

Sketch of the algorithm:

    1) Unify with every clause -> return cand. set
    2) Q approximates Union(h_i)   the h_i's are local cand sets.
    3) Heuristically: Choose candidate
    4) Split cases:


For your second question, I think we agreed on that we postpone the decision
in form of constraints.

Keep track of multiplicity
    q : eq (lam _) (app _ _)
    h : eq X X   (rewriting it to   h: eq X Y   with    X = Y)

Another example was:
    q :  eq (app E1 E2) E3
    h : eq X X

Does this still make sense?

We could reuse some splitting code, with metaabstract.  However the latest
meta-abstract has parameter blocks.  Maybe the old splitting operation from
the m2 directory?  It is reasonably clean.

What about output coverage? What are the "ignore" arguments?  Those that do
not
occur in a + position in the head?

I am not sure, how much effort that is to ensure that "ignore" arguments are
never matched.  Programming in mode dependency order seems to be cleaner.
However, in meta-abstract, I also just do the left-to-right traversal.  It
worked there, so it should be fine.

Hi Carsten,

  here are some notes on the algorithm for output coverage.
I am using as an example:

tp : type.				%name tp A.
arrow : tp -> tp -> tp.

exp : tp -> type.			%name exp E x.
lam : (exp A -> exp B) -> exp (arrow A B).
app : exp (arrow A B) -> exp A -> exp B.

cp : exp A -> exp A -> type.		%name cp D u.

cp_lam : cp (lam E) (lam F)
	  <- ({x:exp A} {y:exp A} cp x y -> cp (E x) (F y)).
	     
cp_app : cp (app E1 E2) (app F1 F2)
	  <- cp E1 F1
	  <- cp E2 F2.


When examining a subgoal, we are in a context with two parts: the
existential and the universal part.  We represent the universal
part via explicit abstraction.  From cp_lam:

{A:tp} {B:tp} {E:exp A -> exp B} {F:exp A -> exp B}
|- {x:exp A} {y:exp A} {u:cp x y} cp (E x) (F y)

Lets call this the coverage clause.  Since we don't factor different
clauses for output coverage, the coverage clauses is unique.

We next set up the initial coverage goal.  For this coverage goal the
output arguments of the eventual atomic subgoal are maximally general
(irrelevant arguments are replaced by underscore here for simplicity).
Splittable variables are named V* and local parameters remain in the
coverage goal.

{A*:tp} {B*:tp} {G*:exp A* -> exp A* -> exp B*}
?- {x:exp A*} {y:exp A*} {u:cp x y} cp _ (G* x y)

Now we perform matching as for input coverage: we check if
the single coverage clause above covers the single coverage
goal below.

We instantiate A, B, E, F with new logical variables _A, _B, _E, _F that
can depend on A*, B*, G* (modulo subordination) and match

{A*:tp} {B*:tp} {G*:exp A* -> exp A* -> exp B*}
?- {x:exp A} {y:exp A} {u:cp x y} cp (E x) (F y)
   = {x:exp A*} {y:exp A*} {u:cp x y} cp _ (G* x y) : type

In this case this fails because of dependencies, where G* is
not suggested as a splitting candidate.

If we modify our example slightly (e.g. cp (E x) (app (F1 y) (F2 y))
in the subgoal), the G* would become a candidate.  In that case
we split the goal

{A*:tp} {B*:tp} {G*:exp A* -> exp A* -> exp B*}
?- {x:exp A*} {y:exp A*} {u:cp x y} cp _ (G* x y)

by instantiating A*, B*, G* with new EVars (but not x, y, u),
enumerating all possibilities for G*, then abstracting to
obtain, for example (among others):

{A*:tp} {B1*:tp} {B2*:tp}
{G1*:exp A* -> exp A* -> exp (arrow B1* B2*)}
{G2*:exp A* -> exp A* -> exp B1*}
?- {x:exp A*} {y:exp A*} {u:cp x y} cp _ (app (G1* x y) (G2* x y))

Then we proceed as before, this time without candidates.

The main generalization to the current situation is that coverage clauses
and coverage goals are no longer atomic.

I am not sure if this is sound and terminating for the second-order
case, but it seems at least plausible.  I haven't consider the case
where local assumptions again have subgoals, because some issues of
quantifier alternation may come into play.

One possibility would be to rule that out for the moment, giving
an error message for orders >= 3, and just implement what I sketched
above.

What do you think?  Do you believe the development above?
Do you have any ideas for orders >= 3?  I'll wait for your input
before proceeding with the implementation.

Output coverage for orders >= 3
Sun Dec 23 11:04:20 2001 fp

Example (from fp-examples/coverage/third.elf)

   tp : type.				%name tp A.
   arrow : tp -> tp -> tp.

   exp : tp -> type.			%name exp E x.
   lam : (exp A -> exp B) -> exp (arrow A B).
   app : exp (arrow A B) -> exp A -> exp B.
   callcc : (({C:tp} exp A -> exp C) -> exp A) -> exp A.

   %block exp_var : some {A:tp} block {x:exp A}.
   %block exp_cont : some {A:tp} block {k:{C:tp} exp A -> exp C}.
   %worlds (exp_var | exp_cont) (exp _).

   cp : exp A -> exp A -> type.		%name cp D u.

   cp_lam : cp (lam E) (lam F)
	     <- ({x:exp A} cp x x -> cp (E x) (F x)).

   cp_app : cp (app E1 E2) (app F1 F2)
	     <- cp E1 F1
	     <- cp E2 F2.

   cp_callcc : cp (callcc E) (callcc F)
		<- ({k:{C:tp} exp A -> exp C}
		      ({C:tp} {H:exp A} {H':exp A} cp (k C H) (k C H') <- cp H H')
		      -> cp (E k) (F k)).

   %mode cp +E -F.
   %block cp_var : some {A:tp} block {x:exp A} {u:cp x x}.
   %block cp_cont : some {A:tp} block {k:{C:tp} exp A -> exp C}
		    {w:{C:tp} {H:exp A} {H':exp A} cp (k C H) (k C H') <- cp H H'}.
   %worlds (cp_var | cp_cont) (cp E F).
   %covers cp +E -F.
   %total E (cp E _).

First-layer output coverage of cp_callcc:

  Output coverage: cp_callcc
  ?- {A1:tp} {E1:({C:tp} exp A1 -> exp C) -> exp A1}
	{E2:({C:tp} exp A1 -> exp C) -> exp A1}
	|- {k:{C:tp} exp A1 -> exp C}
	      ({C:tp} {H:exp A1} {H':exp A1} cp H H' -> cp (k C H) (k C H'))
		 -> cp (E1 k) (E2 k).
                              |----|
  Covered

Second-layer output coverage would involve:

  ?- {A1:tp} {E1:({C:tp} exp A1 -> exp C) -> exp A1}
	{E2:({C:tp} exp A1 -> exp C) -> exp A1}
	|- {k:{C:tp} exp A1 -> exp C}
	      ({C:tp} {H:exp A1} {H':exp A1} cp H H').
                                                 |-|
and also (?)

  ?- {A1:tp} {E1:({C:tp} exp A1 -> exp C) -> exp A1}
	{E2:({C:tp} exp A1 -> exp C) -> exp A1}
	|- {C:tp} exp A1.

except exp A1 is never a subgoal and has no mode.

For input coverage, we have the invariant that no input argument
ever depends on an output argument.  So when we match input arguments
to determine if a case is covered, the two terms have the same type,
even if we ignore (as we do) all output arguments.

For output coverage, we would like to ignore the input arguments
and just match the output arguments to see if a case is covered.
However, the output arguments DO depend on the input arguments.

So at first I simply also matched the input arguments.  In principle,
this should never fail, because originally the cover goal is a
generalization of the cover clause by replacing the output arguments
with a free variable, leaving all input arguments the same.  When we
split in the cover goal, the variables in the cover goal are only
instantiated, and thereby should remain an instance of the cover clause.

Unfortunately, because of constraints, unification sometimes fails to
realize that this is the case.  So coverage checking failed because even
matching of non-patterns is incomplete.

So I simply removed the matching on input arguments.  This means we will
sometimes unify two output arguments whose types have not previously
been unified, although we always know that one is an instance of the
other.  Kevin and I convinced ourselves that in the case of matching,
this should remain sound: if matching succeeds, then by using the
existing (although not computing) match in the index arguments, the two
terms must always be identical.

In the end I couldn't see any other solution.

Hope this makes sense...

function coverageCheckCases

Recall:

G |- U : V   G' |- s : G
------------------------
G' |- U[s] : V[s]


---------------------------
G,x1:A1,...,xn:An |- ^n : G

G' |- s : G   G' |- U : A[s]   (since G |- A : type, G' |- A[s] : type)
----------------------------
G' |- U.s : G,x:A

Non-dependent example:

coverageCheckCases (Cs, G) where
G  = x : nat
Cs =     . |- (z/x) : (x:nat)   [1]
     y:nat |- (sy/x) : (x:nat)  [2]

To check: for every . |- r : G
          there exists k and  . |- t : Gk such that  r = sk o t 

Approach: Build  H0 |- r0 : G  for H0 = G
          Determine if there is Gk |- sk : G
          such that r0 = sk o t for some H0 |- t : Gk

Determine candidates in r0 (H0)
Split candidate to construct a set of r1s and H1's and for each:
          H1 |- r1 : H0  and  H1 |- r0 o r1 : G
          Determine if there is Gk |- sk : G
          such that r1 = sk o t for some H1 |- t : Gk

Etc.
------------------------------
Back to example:
G = x:nat
H0 = x':nat  [contains splittable variables]
r0 = x'/x      
with x:nat |- (x/x) : x:nat

Match    H0 |- (z/x) >= (x'/x) : G
         Clash z <> x' [constant / splittable var], splitting candidate x'

Match    H0 |- (sY/x) >= (x'/x) : G
         Clash s <> x' [constant / splittable var], splitting candidate x'

Split x':nat.  Two subgoals

[a] r1 = z/x', H1 = . where . |- (z/x') : (x':nat)
    r0 o r1 = z/x  where   . |- (z/x) : G

Match  H1 |- (z/x) >= (z/x) : G
       Success.

[b] r1 = sx''/x', H1 = x'':nat  where x'':nat |- (sx''/x') : (x':nat)
    r0 o r1 = sx''/x  where   x'':nat |- (sx''/x) : G

Match  H1 |- (z/x) >= (sx''/x) : G
       Fails [constant / constant clash], no splitting candidates

Match  H1 |- (sY/x) >= (sx''/x) : G
where  H1 |- Y : nat
       Success.

Coverage satisfied.
