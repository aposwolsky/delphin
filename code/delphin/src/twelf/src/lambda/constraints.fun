  (*
     Constraints cnstr are of the form (X<I>[s] = U).
     Invariants:
       G |- s : G'  G' |- X<I> : V
       G |- U : W
       G |- V[s] == W : L
       (X<>,s) is whnf, but X<>[s] is not a pattern
     If X<I> is uninstantiated, the constraint is inactive.
     If X<I> is instantiated, the constraint is active.

     Constraints are attached directly to the EVar X
     or to a descendent  -fp?
