There is a problem with Skolem constants.  They cannot be applied to
local parameters, otherwise the LF/meta level distinction is violated.
In filling.fun I am lowering EVars (in createEVars), and there it is 
possible that local parameters get into the context G, which can
be used  (in search.fun) as arguments via unfications.  This is a bug.
