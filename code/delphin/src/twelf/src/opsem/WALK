Main Current Issues

 - changed call to unify to use Unify.unifiable and avoid handler with
   large scope. -fp DONE
 - Add representation invariants to compsyn. -fp DONE

Main Future Issues

 - closures for goals and residuals goals? -fp
 - improve on-the-fly compilation by avoiding full normalization. -fp
 - associativity of "&" for residual goals. -fp
 - redundant creation of EVar. - fp
 - reevaluation which goals, resgoals should allow closures. -fp
 - rename dPool???? -fp,cs
