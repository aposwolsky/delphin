To build Elphin, simply do "make".  
This will create an executable "bin/elphin" that you can run.

OR Alternatively,
you can start SML and then do:
- CM.make "sources.cm";
- Nabla.top();
and this will also get you to Elphin

Once inside Elphin, to load a file simply do:
<E> use "../example/example.elphin";
