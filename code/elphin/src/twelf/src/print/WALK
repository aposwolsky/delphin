Current issues
  - invariants in print.fun.  Added some -fp DONE

Future issues:

  - have true clause printing, including variable case.
    what is there works on prover output, but not in general.

  - printing of EVars---take subordination into account??
    Example: trace in Mini-ML:
      of (app (app (fix [add] lam [x] lam [y]
		      case y x [y'] s (app (app add x) y'))
           (s (s z))) (s (s (s z))))
      T.
